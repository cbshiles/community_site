   HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets &lt; &gt;. There are opening and closing tags. Sometimes there are opening tags that don't have closing tags. This means that that type of tag can't have more HTML inside of it as content. (Might sound confusing but its not) The closing tag ends the content inside the tag, and has a slash before the tag name.

Example:
    &lt;p&gt;Paragraph 1.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paragraph 2&lt;/p&gt;
    <p>Paragraph 1.</p> <p>Paragraph 2</p>

Inside of these brackets are the tag name, and the opening tag can also have properties for the tag. 

Example:
    &lt;a href="http://google.com"&gt;Link to Google!&lt;/a&gt;
    <a href="http://google.com">Link to Google!</a>

The image tag is an example of a tag that doesn't come in a pair. This is because you're not allowed to put more content inside of the picture!

Example:
	&lt;img src="http://www.webstaurantstore.com/images/products/extra_large/89188/726588.jpg" width="200" height="200"&gt;
<img src="http://www.webstaurantstore.com/images/products/extra_large/89188/726588.jpg" width="200" height="200">

You can leave off the width and height if you want the image to maintain its original size.

An iframe tag is how you embed a video or another website. Youtube gives you this code if you click <i>Share</i> and then <i>Embed</i> right under the video. 

Example:
	&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/maAFcEU6atk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/maAFcEU6atk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
