1 Refer to Table 2: Sample Sizes When Data Are Available on the Product Line Being Measured in this section to determine the minimum
required sample size.
2 If reducing the sample size based on the current year’s administrative rate or the prior year’s product line-specific rate for this measure, the
lowest rate from all the indicators must be used.
3 If a separate sample from the Childhood Immunization Status measure is used for Lead Screening in Children, the organization can reduce
the sample based on the product-line specific current measurement year’s administrative rate or the prior year’s reported rate for Lead
Screening in Children.
4 If reducing the sample size based on the product-line- specific rate for Comprehensive Diabetes Care, the organization must first take the
inverse of the HbA1c poor control &gt;9.0% rate (100 minus the HbA1c poor control rate) and then reduce using the lowest rate among all the
reported CDC indicators.
5 The same sample may be used for the Medication Reconciliation Post-Discharge and Transitions of Care measures. Because the
Transitions of Care measure is a first-year measure, sample size reduction is not allowed. If an organization reduces its sample for the
Medication Reconciliation Post-Discharge measure, the samples for the two measures will be different.
6 If reducing the sample size based on the product-line- specific current measurement year’s administrative rate or the prior year’s reported
rate, the lowest of the three rates for Timeliness of Prenatal Care, Postpartum Care and the rate for women who received 81 percent or
more of expected prenatal care visits must be used for both Prenatal and Postpartum Care and Frequency of Ongoing Prenatal Care.
7 If reducing the sample size based on the product-line- specific current measurement year’s administrative rate or the prior year’s reported
rate for Well-Child Visits in the First 15 Months of Life, the rate for children who received six or more well-child visits must be used.

Note
 Truncate the decimal portion of the rate to obtain a whole number.
 For the commercial and Medicaid product lines, the Comprehensive Diabetes Care sample size is 548. The
intent of this sample size is to achieve a sample of at least 411 for the HbA1c Control &lt;7.0% for a Selected
Population denominator after the required exclusions are applied. The organization may reduce the sample
size using the lowest rate among the 7 indicators calculated from the current year’s administrative rate or
the prior year’s reported rate, but it must maintain the applicable sample size listed in Table 2 in the HbA1c
Control &lt;7.0% for a Selected Population denominator after the required exclusions are applied. For
example, if the organization’s lowest audited CDC rate reported in the prior year is 70 percent, the sample
size may not fall below 348 for all 7 indicators (including the HbA1c Control &lt;7% for a Selected Population
indicator, after removing required exclusions).

Systematic Sampling Methodology
NCQA implemented a systematic sampling scheme for the Hybrid Method. Proper use and implementation of
this method ensures ongoing integrity of collected data and supports increasing requests for audited data.
Complete the following steps for each hybrid measure.
Step 1 Determine the eligible member (EM) population. Develop a list of EMs, including full name (last,
first), date of birth and event (if applicable). An organization that reports on combined HMO/POS
or HMO/POS/PPO/EPO products must include all EMs from all products.
Step 2 Determine the minimum required sample size (MRSS) from Table 1 or Table 2. This number
becomes the denominator for the measure. Use either Table 1 or Table 2, as appropriate, to
determine the MRSS. (Refer to Determining the required sample size for instructions.) If the
EM is  MRSS, proceed to step 4.
Note: The MRSS may only be the appropriate value from Table 1 or Table 2.
To use a larger MRSS, an organization must provide written rationale to NCQA through the PCS
system at http://my.ncqa.org.
Step 3 Determine the oversample. The oversample should be an adequate number of additional records
to make substitutions. Oversample only enough to guarantee that the MRSS is met; keep
substitution criteria in mind.
Written approval from NCQA must be obtained to use an oversampling rate larger than 20
percent. Refer to Oversample requests to NCQA for details.
The oversample records should be used, and reported, only to replace cases taken out of the
MRSS because of valid data errors, false positives, etc., otherwise, these records should not be
reported on in the final denominator.
Step 4  If EM MRSS, all eligible members are included in the sample.
 If EM &gt;MRSS, go to step 5.
 If MRSS &lt;EM MRSS + all oversample records, proceed to step 8.
Step 5 Sort the list of EMs in alphabetical order (by applicable measurement year) by last name, first
name, date of birth and event (if applicable). If the organization reports on combined products
(i.e., HMO/POS or HMO/POS/PPO/EPO), it must alphabetize the combined EM population from
both products.
Sort EMs from A to Z in even measurement years and from Z to A in odd measurement years.
For example, for HEDIS 2018 (2017 measurement year), sort the list of EMs from Z to A. For
HEDIS 2019 (2018 measurement year), sort the list from A to Z.
Note: Sort order applies to all components. For HEDIS 2018, sort all fields by descending order
(i.e., last name descending, first name descending, date of birth descending, event descending).

HEDIS 2018, Volume 2
Step 6 Calculate N = EM/MRSS + all oversample records. Round down to a whole number.
Determine N, which is used in the formula to determine which member will start your sample.
N is calculated using the equation:

N = EM/MRSS + all oversample records

where EM = the eligible member population (step 1) and MRSS = the minimum required sample
size (step 2).
Step 7 Calculate START = (RAND  N). Before choosing members, determine the member to start with
(START). It is important that the sample be selected from a single pass through the member list.
START can have many values and still allow only one pass.
In October 2017, NCQA will release a Random Number (RAND) table that lists a value between 0
and 1 for each measure where the Hybrid Method is applicable. Refer to this table to determine
the RAND to be used when determining START. The RAND for each measure is used to calculate
the starting point from which to draw the final sample.
Calculate the number from which to start drawing the final sample as follows:

START = (RAND  N)

(round per the .5 rule to the nearest whole number greater than 0), where RAND = the random
number for each respective measure identified from Volume 2 Technical Update, released in
October 2017.
Step 8 Select the sample, choosing every i th member using the formula:

i th member = START + [(i-1) x (EM/MRSS + all oversample records)]
(rounding [(i-1) x (EM/MRSS + all oversample records)] per the .5 rule to the nearest whole
number greater than 0).
For i = 2,3,4, …, MRSS where EM = the eligible member population (step 1). MRSS = the
minimum required sample size (step 2).
Starting with the member corresponding to the number START, choose every i th member until the
MRSS is met. This becomes the primary list of sampled members.
Continue choosing every i th member until the oversample is met. This set of members becomes
the oversample. The oversample records should be used, and reported, only to replace cases
taken out of the MRSS because of valid data errors, false positives, etc., otherwise, these records
should not be reported on in the final denominator.
Note: From step 4, if MRSS &lt;EM ≤MRSS + all oversample records, sort the EMs in alphabetical
order (by applicable measurement year) by last name, first name, date of birth and event (if
applicable). Choose the first MRSS EMs as the primary sample and the remaining EMs as the
oversample.
The oversample list is only used to replace exclusions. All exclusions must be documented because they may
be subject to audit.
Oversample
requests to
NCQA

Any oversampling rate larger than 20 percent must be approved by NCQA annually.
Organizations submit a formal request with the rationale to NCQA through the PCS
system at http://my.ncqa.org.
NCQA provides written notification of approval or disapproval within seven business
days. The organization must maintain the documentation for the HEDIS Compliance
Audit.

Oversampling
methodology

For hybrid measures, the starting sample size must be higher than the designated
sample size because medical records must be substituted if a member is ineligible for
the measure; for example, if a member was incorrectly identified as a diabetic through
administrative data or meets exclusion criteria for the measure.
To adjust for this, divide the sample size by the percentage of charts expected to
be inappropriate for review. Suppose 10 percent of charts are expected to be
inappropriate for the measure.
To determine the oversample, multiply the MRSS by the oversample percent and
round up to the nearest whole number.

411  0.10 = 42.1
(rounded up to 43 = oversample).
The recommended methodology for substitution is:
 Replace the member’s chart with that of the first member in the oversample list.
 Continue replacing each ineligible member with the next consecutive member of
the oversample list.
If the initial oversample was underestimated and all oversample members have been
exhausted without satisfying the MRSS, the organization must contact NCQA through
the PCS system at http://my.ncqa.org to determine next steps.
Organizations must only use the oversample for substitution and must report all
measures using their MRSS.
Note: Many factors must be considered when determining the initial sample size and
oversampling percentage—such as previous years’ data, frequency of exclusions and
claims lag.

Example 1
The eligible population for the commercial product line for Adult BMI Assessment is 9,000. Reduce the
minimum required sample size using the commercial rate from the prior year’s HEDIS submission, which was
77 percent. Based on experience, estimate a 5 percent oversample rate. Follow the systematic sampling
scheme.
Step 1 EM = 9,000.
Step 2 From Table 2, the MRSS is 296.
Step 3 Oversample = 296  .05 = 14.8 (the next whole number above is 15, so oversample = 15).
Step 4 Because 9,000 &gt; 296 (MRSS) and 311 (296 + oversample), go to step 5.
Step 5 Sort the list alphabetically and in this order: last name, first name, date of birth.
Step 6 N = 9,000/311 (MRSS + oversample) = 28.
Step 7 For this example, assume that RAND = 0.66, so START = 0.66 x 28 = 18.48.

 Rounding using the .5 rule, START = 18.
 The 18th sorted member is chosen first.
 The 2nd member chosen is the 18 + [(2-1) x (9,000/311)] = 18 + 29 = 47th sorted member,
after rounding the term [(2-1) x (9,000/311)] to 29, using the .5 rule.
 The 3rd member chosen is the 18 + [(3-1) x (9,000/311)] = 18 + 58 = 76th sorted member.

HEDIS 2018, Volume 2

 The 296th member (the last one in the primary list) is the 18 + [(296-1) x (9,000/311)] =
18 + 8,537 = 8,555th sorted member.
 The last member in the oversample* is the 18 + [(311-1) x (9,000/311)] = 18 + 8,971 =
8,989th sorted member.
*Remember, members in the oversample are used only to replace members excluded from the sample.
Example 2
The eligible member population for Colorectal Cancer Screening is 389. This measure was not collected last
year, nor will the administrative rate from this year be used to reduce the sample size. Follow the systematic
sampling scheme.
Step 1 EM = 389.
Step 2 From Table 1, the MRSS is 411. Since 389 &lt;411, skip to step 4.
Step 3 Skip this step.
Step 4 Include all 389 members in your primary list.
Example 3
The eligible member population for Childhood Immunization Status is 436. The sample size will not be
adjusted using this year’s administrative rate. Based on experience with this population, about 10 percent of
the members from the primary sample will have to be excluded. Follow the systematic sampling scheme.
Step 1 EM = 436.
Step 2 From Table 1, the MRSS is 411.
Step 3 Oversample = 411  .10 = 41.1 (the next whole number above is 42, so the oversample= 42).
Step 4 Because 411 &lt;436, skip to step 6.
Step 5 Skip this step.
Step 6 Sort the list and choose the first 411 as the primary list. The remaining 25 members become the
oversample list*.
*Remember, members in the oversample are used only to replace members excluded from the sample.
