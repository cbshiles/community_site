         18. Ku / Work on what has been spoiled [ Decay ]</p>
                         
  <p>  above  KÃªn  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN<br>
         below  Sun  THE GENTLE, WIND</p>
                         
  <p>  The Chinese character ku represents a bowl in whose contents worms
    are breeding. This means decay. IT is come about because the gentle indifference
    in the lower trigram has come together with the rigid inertia of the
upper,     and the result is stagnation. Since this implies guilt, the conditions
 embody   a demand for removal of the cause. Hence the meaning of the hexagram
 is not  simply "what has been spoiled" but "work on what has been spoiled".</p>
                         
  <p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                         
  <p>  WORK ON WHAT HAS BEEN SPOILED<br>
         Has supreme success.<br>
         It furthers one to cross the great water.<br>
         Before the starting point, three days.<br>
         After the starting point, three days.</p>
                         
  <p>  What has been spoiled through man's fault can be made good again through
    man's work. IT is not immutable fate, as in the time of STANDSTILL, that
   has caused the state of corruption, but rather the abuse of human freedom.
   Work toward improving conditions promises well, because it accords the
possibilities    of the time. We must not recoil from work and danger-symbolized
by crossing    of the great water-but must take hold energetically. Success
depends, however,    on proper deliberation. This is expressed by the lines,
"Before the starting    point, three days. After the starting point, three
days." We must first  know  the cause of corruption before we can do away
with them; hence it is  necessary  to be cautious during the time before
the start. Then we must see to it that  the new way is safely entered upon,
so that a relapse may be avoided; therefore  we must pay attention to the
time after the start. Decisiveness and energy  must take the place of inertia
and indifference that have led to decay, in  order that the ending may be
followed by a new beginning. </p>
                         
  <p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                         
  <p>  The wind blows low on the mountain:<br>
         The image of DECAY.<br>
         Thus the superior man stirs up the people<br>
         And strengthens their spirit.</p>
                         
  <p>  When the wind blow s slow on the mountain, it is thrown back and spoils
    the vegetation. This contains a challenge to improvement. It is the same
   with debasing attitudes and fashions; they corrupt human society. His
methods    likewise must be derived from the two trigrams, but in such a
way that their   effects unfold in orderly sequence. The superior must first
remove stagnation   by stirring up public opinion, as the wind stirs up everything,
and must  strengthen and tranquilize the character of the people, as the
mountain gives  tranquillity and nourishment to all that grows in its vicinity.

  <p>LINE CHANGES:</p>
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Setting right what has been spoiled by the father.<br>
         There will be a little remorse. No great blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  This describes a man who proceeds a little too energetically in righting
    the mistakes of the past. Now and then, as a result, minor discourse
and    annoyances will surely develop. But too much energy is better than
too little.   Therefore, although he may at times have slight cause for regret,
he remains   free of any serious blame. </p>
                         

  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He does not serve kings and princes,<br>
         Sets himself higher goals.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  Not every man has an obligation to mingle in the affairs of the world.
    There are some who are developed to such a degree that they are justified
    in letting the world go its own way and refusing to enter public life
with    a view to reforming it. But this does not imply a right to remain
idle or   to sit back and merely criticize. Such withdrawal is justified
only when  we strive to realize in ourselves the higher aims of mankind.
For although   the sage remains distant from the turmoil of daily life, he
creates incomparable    human values for the future. </p>

  <p>  <p>CONVERTED HEXAGRAM:</p>

         7. Shih / The Army</p>
                         
  <p>  above  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH<br>
         below  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER</p>
                         
  <p>  This hexagram is made up of the trigrams K'an, water, and K'un, earth,
    and thus it symbolizes the ground water stored up in the earth. In the
 same   way military strength is stored up in the mass of the people--invisible
  in  times of peace but always ready for use as a source of power. The attributes
    of the two trig rams are danger inside and obedience must prevail outside.
     Of the individual lines, the one that controls the hexagram is the strong
    nine in the second place, to which the other lines, all yielding, are
subordinate.    This line indicates a commander, because it stands in the
middle of one  of  the two trigrams. But since it is in the lower rather
than the upper trigram,  it represents not the ruler but the efficient general,
who maintains obedience  in the army by his authority.</p>
                         
  <p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                         
  <p>  THE ARMY. The army needs perseverance<br>
         And a strong man.<br>
         Good fortune without blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  An army is a mass that needs organization in order to become a fighting
    force.<br>
         Without strict discipline nothing can be accomplished, but this
discipline     must not be achieved by force. It requires a strong man who
captures the    hearts of the people and awakens their enthusiasm. In order
that he may  develop  his abilities he needs the complete confidence of his
ruler, who  must entrust   him with full responsibility as long as the war
lasts. But  war is always  a dangerous thing and brings with it destruction
and devastation.  Therefore   it should not be resorted to rashly but, like
a poisonous drug,  should be   used as a last recourse.</p>
                         
  <p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                         
  <p>  In the middle of the earth is water:<br>
         The image of THE ARMY.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man increases his masses<br>
         By generosity toward the people.</p>
                         
  <p>  Ground water is invisibly present within the earth. In the same way
    the military power of a people is invisibly present in the masses. When
  danger  threatens, every peasant becomes present in the masses. When danger
  threatens,  every peasant becomes a soldier; when the war ends, he goes
back  to his plow.  He who is generous toward the people wins their love,
and a  people living  under a mild rule becomes strong and powerful. Only
a people  economically  strong can be important in military power. Such power
must therefore be cultivated  by improving the economic condition of the
people and by humane government.  Only when there is this invisible bond
between government and people, so that the people are sheltered by their
government as ground water is sheltered  by the earth, is it possible to
wage a victorious war.</p>
