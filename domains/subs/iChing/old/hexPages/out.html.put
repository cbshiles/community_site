  <p>  above  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER<br>
         below  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH</p>
                         
  <p>  The waters on the surface of the earth flow together wherever they
    can, as for example in the ocean, where all the rivers come together.
Symbolically    this connotes holding together and the laws that regulate
it. The same idea   is suggested by the fact that all the lines of the hexagram
except the fifth,   the place of the ruler, are yielding. The yielding lines
hold together because   they are influenced by a man of strong will in the
leading position, a man   who is their center of union. Moreover, this strong
and guiding personality   in turn holds together with the others, finding
in them the complement of   his own nature.</p>
                         
  <p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                         
  <p>  HOLDING TOGETHER brings good fortune.<br>
         Inquire of the oracle once again<br>
         Whether you possess sublimity, constancy, and perseverance;<br>
         Then there is no blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  Those who are uncertain gradually join.<br>
         Whoever come too late<br>
         Meets with misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  What is required is that we unite with others, in order that all may
    complement and aid one another through holding together. But such holding
    together calls for a central figure around whom other persons may unite.
   To become a center of influence holding people together is a grave matter
   and fraught with great responsibility. It requires greatness of spirit,
 consistency,   and strength. Therefore let him who wishes to gather others
 about him ask   himself whether he is equal to the undertaking, for anyone
 attempting the   task without a real calling for it only makes confusion
worse than if no  union at all had taken place.  But when there is a real
rallying point, those  who at first are hesitant or uncertain gradually come
in of their own accord.   Late-comers must suffer the consequences, for in
holding together the question   of the right time is also important. Relationships
 are formed and firmly  established according to definite inner laws. Common
 experiences strengthen  these ties, and he who comes too late to share in
 these basic experiences  must suffer for it if, as a straggler, he finds
the door locked.  If a man  has recognized the necessity for union and does
not feel strong enough to  function as the center, it is his duty to become
a member of some other organic  fellowship.</p>
                         
  <p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                         
  <p>  On the earth is water:<br>
         The image of HOLDING TOGETHER.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the kings of antiquity<br>
         Bestowed the different states as fiefs<br>
         And cultivated friendly relations<br>
         With the feudal lords.</p>
                         
  <p>  Water fills up all the empty places on the earth and clings fast to
    it. The social organization of ancient China was based on this principle
   of the holding together of dependents and rulers. Water flows to unite
with   water, because all parts of it are subject to the same laws. So too
should   human society hold together through a community of interests that
allows  each individual to feel himself a member of a whole. The central
power of  a social organization must see to it that every member finds that
his true  interest lies in holding together with it, as was the case in the
paternal  relationship between king and vassals in ancient China.</p>
                         
  <p>LINE CHANGES:</p>
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>

                         
  <p>  Hold to him in truth and loyalty;<br>
         This is without blame.<br>
         Truth, like a full earthen bowl"<br>
         Thus in the end<br>
         Good fortune comes from without.</p>
                         
  <p>  Fundamental sincerity is the only proper basis for forming relationships.
    This attitude, symbolized by a full earthen bowl, in which the content
 is   everything and the empty form nothing, shows itself not in clever words
  but  through the strength of what lies within the speaker. This strength
 is so  great that it has power to attract good fortune to itself from without.</p>
                         

  <p>  Six in the second place means:</p>

                         
  <p>  Hold to him inwardly.<br>
         Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  If a person responds perseveringly and in the right way to the behests
    from above that summon him to action, his relations with others are intrinsic
    and he does not lose himself. But if a man seeks association with others
   as if he were an obsequious office hunter, he throws himself away. He
does    not follow the path of the superior man, who never loses his dignity.</p>
                         

  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>

                         
  <p>  You hold together with the wrong people.</p>
                         
  <p>  We are often among people who do not belong to our own sphere. In
that case we must beware of being drawn into false intimacy through force
of habit. Needless to say, this would have evil consequences. Maintaining
sociability without intimacy is the only right attitude toward people, because
otherwise we should not be free to enter into relationship with people of
our own kind later on.</p>
